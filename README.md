## Description

_The program does nothing to non-alphabetical characters, since they do not contain consonants or vowels.
Example Input: 3
Example Output: 3
Capitalization doesn't change regardless of order in a word or sentence.
Example Input: Hi my name is Bob.
Example Output: iHay ymay amenay isway obBay
The program add “way” to the end of single vowel words.
Example Input: a
Example Output: away
The program add “way” to the end of words beginning with a vowel.
Example Input: apple
Example Output: appleway
For words beginning with one or more consonants the program will move all of the first consecutive consonants to the end, and add "ay.”
Example Input: train
Example Output: aintray
If the first consonants include "qu", the program will move the "u" along with the "q" to the end and add “ay.”
Example Input: queen
Example Output: eenquay
If the first consonants include "qu", the program will move the "u" along with the rest of the consonants to the end and add “ay.”
Example Input: squeal
Example Output: ealsquay
For words beginning with "y", the program will treat "y" as a consonant.
Example Input: yarn

The same rules apply in sentences as they do with single words.
